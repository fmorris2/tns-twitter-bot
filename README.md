# tns-twitter-bot
Consumes the Twitter news scraper (TNS) web service, and periodically posts trending news stories to a twitter account.

### Architecture
- Language: [C](http://www.cprogramming.com/)
- Libraries:

    - [cJSON](https://github.com/DaveGamble/cJSON)
    
### Overview
Meant to make use of the TNS web service that I made, tns-twitter-bot (ttb) will consume the web service and periodically tweet relevant trending news stories. TTB will function as a dynamic news source, always up to date with the subjects that people are talking about.

### Basic Logic Flow
